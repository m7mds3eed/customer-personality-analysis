## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required Python libraries using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To run the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in order:
jupyter notebook 'Customer Segmentation Analysis.ipynb'

## Results
The segmentation identifies two distinct customer groups:

### Cluster 0: High-Spending Older Customers
- **Characteristics**: Higher income, substantial total spent, frequent purchases.
- **Age**: Predominantly older.
- **Customer Tenure**: Long-term customers with the company.
- **Family Members**: Generally has less family members
- **Potential Strategy:** Focus on premium products, loyalty programs, and personalized offers to retain these high-value customers.

### Cluster 1: Lower-Spending Younger Customers
- **Characteristics**: Lower income, modest total spent, fewer purchases.
- **Age**: Generally younger.
- **Customer Tenure**: Relatively new to the company.
- **Family Members**: Generally has more family members
- **Potential Strategy:** Focus on value-for-money products, discounts, and promotional campaigns to increase engagement and spending.
